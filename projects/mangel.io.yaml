description: |
  The issue management developed for a construction firm is meant for construction managers.
  Construction managers may inspect the construction site and create new issues in the iOS app.
  In the office, on a webpage all open issues can be reviewed, pdf reports can be generated and the craftsman can be informed per e-mail.
  The craftsman has its personal link with all assigned issues, and can mark them as complete.
  In the end, the construction manager reviews the complete issues.
