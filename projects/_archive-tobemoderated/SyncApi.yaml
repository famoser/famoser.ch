name: SyncApi
purpose: a nuget portable library to sync models in a very convenient way
description: "this library allows to connect to the sync api webpage, and then save\
  \ any entites (after implementing a small interface) to it. All entries will be\
  \ synced over all UWP devices automatically. \r\n\r\nYou can customize pretty much\
  \ everything is this repository, but get started quickly for simple use cases due\
  \ to clever dependency injection and a prepared standard use case. About 10 LOC\
  \ allow for basic CRUD!\r\n\r\nAll objects are persist with a unique version id,\
  \ so you can even access the history of your objects. All data is available offline,\
  \ initialization is done lazy with observable collections."
