  Developed for three organisations representing their members at UZH (including PhDs, technical & administrative staff, external lecturers).
  Candidates can be voted into different Committees for each faculty.
  Any data can only be edited before the election, and a history of who changed what is kept.
  To vote, the voter logs in with the normal UZH login and then inputs an additional personal authentication code.
  An extensive security analysis and a code review by an external firm was performed.
