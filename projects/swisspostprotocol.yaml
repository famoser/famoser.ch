name: Proof of the Swiss Post Voting System
purpose: review of the computational proof of the Swiss Post Voting System
implementation: |
  The computational proof argues mathematically for security properties of the system and is a necessary requirement for federal elections.
  The proof required a rework to reflect changes in the system and align more closely to the current state of research.
  These changes were reviewed as well as improvements were suggested and implemented.
