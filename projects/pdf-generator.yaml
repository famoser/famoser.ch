name: pdf-generator
purpose: generate pdf with an easy to use php api
implementation: |
  The pdf-generator takes a new approach at pdf generation, providing a higher level api independently of the pdf specific oddities.
  Common tasks such as tables are much easier implemented than with the existing libraries.
  The user works on the level of pages, text and image blocks while the library places the elements appropriately.
  
  To support this approach, the pdf generator was written from scratch as the already existing libraries did not support such a scenario.
  It provides most of the common pdf functionality, notably as text, images and custom fonts.
  To support custom fonts, a parser & generator of TTF subset files was also implemented.
