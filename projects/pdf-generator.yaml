name: PDF writer
purpose: fast pdf generation with a high-level api
implementation: |
  A high-level API abstracts components cleanly - such as paragraphs or tables - for an easier and faster implementation experience.
  The lower-level API provides PDF-specific building blocks while still abstracting PDF implementation details.
  With no external dependencies, the most common pdf functionality is implemented, such as text, images and custom fonts.
  To support custom fonts, a parser and writer of TTF is also part of the project.
