  Hilti organizes the yearly SLAM challenge: Researchers are given a data set (LIDAR, IMU, Camera) and have to infer the position of the device. 
  Participating researchers can upload their best guesses, which are then automatically scored in a docker runtime. 
  When the deadline has passed, the best teams are shown in a leaderboard.
